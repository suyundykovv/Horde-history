# Project: Kazakh Khanate: Struggle for Unity

## General Description
Kazakh Khanate: Struggle for Unity is a turn-based grand strategy game set in the early 18th century, inspired by **Europa Universalis IV (EU4)**. Starting in the year **1721**, players will lead one of the three Juzes—**Middle Juz, Uly Juz, and Kishi Juz**—on a quest to unify the Kazakh Khanate. The game includes interactions with major regional powers such as the **Zhungar Khanate, the Russian Empire, the Qing Dynasty**, and **Central Asian Sultanates**, enriching the gameplay with strategic depth and challenges.
